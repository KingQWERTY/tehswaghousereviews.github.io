Hey guys.
This is the shared repository for the website. All the images you need are in the imgs folder, videos in videos, self-explanatory.
To create a review, duplicate the file called 'review-template.html'. Rename it to the name you need (example: rename the geometry dash review to 'geometrydash.html', 'gd.html', or something similar).
The code may look confusing, but everything has a comment which explains what it is and what to do there. These comments look like this:
```
<!--Comment here.-->
```
Just follow the instructions (or learn HTML). Hate to sound lecturing, but just wanted to let you guys be able to write reviews.
Once you've written your review, you can (optionally) delete all the comments, preview the file and, if you're happy, (optionally) leave a description of what you changed in the bottom box, then hit "Commit changes".
Let's do this.
